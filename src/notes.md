# Evolution of Covid in Austria

## March 2020 - October 2022

Studying the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations on the COVID-19 death rate in Austria.

### Line Graph

The line graph shows the temporal effects of vaccinations on reducing COVID-19-related deaths in the states with the highest and lowest COVID-19 death rates per 1000 cases. Both Vorarlberg and Kärnten experienced somewhat parallel death rates with Kärnten having the highest death rate in Austria and Vorarlberg the lowest. The start of vaccination efforts, marked by the dotted vertical line, is a turning point. Both states see a sustained decline in death rates. Especially in Kärnten, the high death rate could be lowered drastically. The decline in death rates post-vaccination highlights the effectiveness of the vaccines in reducing the severity of the disease's outcomes and underscores the importance of timely and widespread vaccine administration to control the pandemic's impact.

### Choropleth Map

The map shows the sum of COVID-19 deaths per 1000 people in Austria's states. The map highlights the stark differences in deaths across the states. Kärnten has the highest death rate, followed by Steiermark and Niederösterreich. Vorarlberg has the lowest death rate. This could be due to various factors such as population density, healthcare infrastructure, and the number of tests done by the states.
